Request instructions

All api requests currently go through http, not https. This could be changed, but might not be necessary.

Most optional query attributes are null by default, but the request does not accept null to be passed to it in json, you should instead just not mention it in the request.

All file uploads are in ip:3000/uploads/[filename] and thumbnails/[filename], check utils/resize if you wish to change thumbnail size. 

Here are some example requests:

// Gets post by filter and/or query, all lines are optional.
https://localhost:8000/posts
get
{
    "postId": null,
    "responseTo": null,
    "poster": "User",
    "media": null,
    "post": "%WriteSearchHere%",
    "skip": 0,
    "take": 10
}

// Good for infinite lists when loading requests on scroll down.
https://localhost:8000/posts
get
{
    "skip": [loadedItemCount],
    "take": 10
}

// For a specific user's posts. You can really mitchmatch these all you like.
https://localhost:8000/posts
get
{
    "poster": "User"
}

// Gets post by id
https://localhost:8000/posts/:postId
get

// Adds post
// You can also upload a file using body form-data in postman, html form or javascript, so that media wont always be null. The filetype must be set as file, thus just writing a raw json body wont do.
// The following is an example for post without media.

https://localhost:8000/posts
post
{
    "responseTo": 3,
    "poster": "Foo",
    "post": "Jeesh, tough crowd."
}

// Updates post
// All optional except postId

https://localhost:8000/posts
put
{
    "postId": 6,
    "post": "Jeesh, tough crowd!",
    "poster": "Foo",
    "media": "4e355852ce69f9bad586870e3178898a"
}

// Deletes post

https://localhost:8000/posts
delete
{ "postId": 5 }

// Deletes post
https://localhost:8000/posts/:postId
delete
